            <div class="da">Answer：To be at ease, there are two ranks of the wrong in the program：NOTICE and ERROR. When it is a NOTICE rank wrong, it means there is a wrong happened in the process, but these is tolerable, master program can good running normally. But the ERROR rank wrong is fatal, the program will stop immediately, so as the upgrading process. So, you must deal with the situation according to diffent questions when wrong happens.</div>
